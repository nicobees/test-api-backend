### Initial setup

The project uses `standard` code style.
All the necessary modules are installed through `npm install`, but run the following steps for a complete setup:

1. Install `standard` extension for your IDE: see [here](https://github.com/standard/standard#are-there-text-editor-plugins) for instructions
2. Activate auto fix/lint on save on the IDE `standard` extension: if you are using Visual Studio Code this setting is already present (see `.vscode/settings.json`)

Everything is ready to code and run the application.
